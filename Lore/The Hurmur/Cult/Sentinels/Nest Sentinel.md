Chosen by the [[Raven Lady]], sentinels are the enforcers of the laws in [[Followers of Murmur|the cult]]. The amount of [[Mutations]] they were subjected to has made their appearance abnormal, non-human even. In order to not cause distress to people outside of cult, therefore endangering the cult's existence, they are not allowed to leave its grounds, unless ordered otherwise.
